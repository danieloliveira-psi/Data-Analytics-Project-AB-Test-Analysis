# Project: A/B Test Analysis

## Introduction

This is the third project I had to complete for the Data Analytics Nanodegree on Udacity.
For this project, I had to complete the tasks that were requested in the notebook related to discriptive and inferential statistics, so all I had to do was to provide the code that you can see in the jupyter notebook.

## Main Goal

This project aims at performing a A/B test regarding a hypotetic webpage, comparing an update of the page to the previous version.

## What was used

With Anaconda's help, it was used python 3.x, and jupyter.
Regarding packages, it was used pandas, numpy and matplotlib (inline), statsmodels.api and random.
A csv file with the data source for this analysis was used, but it's too big to put it here.

## Other

Please, don't copy this project to conclude similar Udacity (or other platforms) courses. I hope, however, that it can help you with some insights.
